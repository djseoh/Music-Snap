# What is this?
Music Snap is a simple application that is used to display the music you are playing on your spotify. For example, if you're playing "Can't help falling in love" by Elvis Presley, then Music Snap will display a picture of Elvis, lyrics to the song, a bio of Elvis, and a list of similar artists. Music Snap will be awesome to display on a TV in parties as well as in restaurants where customers may be curious as to which song is playing. Although Music Snap is a simple to use application, the applications of it are endless.
